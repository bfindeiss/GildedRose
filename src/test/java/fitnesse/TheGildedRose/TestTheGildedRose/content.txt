Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. 
We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. 
We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. 
Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. 
First an introduction to our system:

All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item

|Items in the Gilded Rose   |
|name     |sellIn|getSellIn?|
|Some Item|20    |20        |

All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is

|Items in the Gilded Rose     |
|name     |quality|getQuality?|
|Some Item|20     |20         |


At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                      |
|name     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Some Item|25     |42    |true          |24                 |41                |


Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                      |
|name     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Some Item|25     |1     |true          |24                 |0                 |
|Some Item|25     |-1    |true          |23                 |-2                |


The Quality of an item is never negative

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                      |
|name     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Some Item|0      |42    |true          |0                  |41                |


“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                      |
|name     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Aged Brie|10     |22    |true          |11                 |21                |


The Quality of an item is never more than 50

-> When adding a new item with quality >50, quality shall be set back to 50

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                      |
|name     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Some Item|80     |42    |true          |50                 |41                |

-> When an item with increasing quality (like "Aged Brie") reaches a quality of 50,
   there shall be no further increase

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                      |
|name     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Aged Brie|50     |22    |true          |50                 |21                |


“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                                       |
|name                      |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros|80     |0     |true          |80                 |0                 |


“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; 

-> Quality increases by 1 if there are more than 10 days left

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                                                      |
|name                                     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert|20     |22    |true          |21                 |21                |

-> Quality increases by 2 if there are between 6 and 10 days left

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                                                      |
|name                                     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert|20     |9     |true          |22                 |8                 |


-> Quality increases by 3 if there are 5 days or less left

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                                                      |
|name                                     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert|20     |5     |true          |23                 |4                 |


-> Quality drops to 0 after the concert

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                                                      |
|name                                     |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert|20     |0     |true          |0                  |-1                |


We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

“Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

-> When the sell date is >0, quality decreases by 2 per day

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                          |
|name         |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Conjured Item|25     |42    |true          |23                 |41                |


-> When the sell date is <0, quality decreases by 4 per day

|Items in the Gilded Rose                                                          |
|name         |quality|sellIn|updateQuality?|qualityAfterUpdate?|sellInAfterUpdate?|
|Conjured Item|25     |-1    |true          |22                 |-2                |


Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. 
However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage 
and one-shot you as he doesn’t believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we’ll cover for you).
